你就算是在很努力的在生活，尝试把每件事都做对，都倾注你的热情，结果，也并不一定是好的。

结果跟你的努力，跟你的投入，或许有一点关系，但是关系并不大。

我现在很理解躺平的人，with or without hard working, 结果都可能是那样，何苦又要努力呢？

怀疑世界，怀疑人生，怀疑自我。我现在都心境，跟这首歌可谓是，一模一样：

> Crawling in my skin
> 
> These wounds, they will not heal
> 
> Fear is how I fall
> 
> Confusing what is real
> 
> There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
> 
> Consuming, confusing
> 
> This lack of self control I fear is never ending
> 
> Controlling
> 
> I can't seem
> 
> To find myself again
> 
> My walls are closing in
> 
> (Without a sense of confidence, I'm convinced)
> 
> (That there's just too much pressure to take)
> 
> I've felt this way before
> 
> So insecure

做个麻木的人，来自我保护吧～~
